# Question

Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - This means that the request succeeded, which in most cases means that the resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.

2. 201 - This is another success message, but it means that whatever you were trying to POST was successful.

3. 204 - This means there is no content in your request to send. It's possible to alter meta-data with this

4. 404 - This means whatever you were searching for the computer can't find. Most times this happens when you have an incorrect ~~html~~ URL

5. 500 - This means a server has entered a scenario where it does not know what to do.
