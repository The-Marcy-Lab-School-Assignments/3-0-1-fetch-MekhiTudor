# Question

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok`& `Response.status` tells us if our request was successful and if not why.

2. `Response.url` - This is the url to where sent our request to and where the response is coming from.

3. `Response.headers` - This provides meta data about our request.
